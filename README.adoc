= Hadoop Token File Utils

Hadoop has the concept of Delegation Tokens. These can be used as a substitute for Kerberos tickets to authenticate against a service.

In Hadoop these are implemented as versions of a more generic `Token` class.
These Tokens can be obtained from the target services by (usually) presenting a Kerberos ticket.

Tokens can be serialized to a file and contain these pieces of information when serialized:

* Identifier
* Password
* Kind
* Service

The different kinds of Tokens might contain extra information. The HDFS Delegation Token for example includes these extra fields (these are transported in the Identifier):

* Owner
* Renewer
* Real user

== Use-case

So we have a bunch of (Delegation) Tokens and we need to store them, what to do?
Hadoop's `Credentials` class has methods to read and write Tokens to a _Token Storage File_.

It may be necessary to interact with those files.
One use-case is when you run an Oozie job which fetches Delegation Tokens for you and places them in a Token Storage file.
If you then want to use the Python HDFS Client to access WebHDFS you need to extract a single token from this file.


== Serialization

Tokens from the `Credentials` class can be stored in two differen formats.

The _legacy_ format uses Hadoop `Writables` and it's still the default in Hadoop 3.0 at least.
Then there's a new format based on Protocol Buffers which has been introduced in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12563[Hadoop 3]

Hadoop 3 also introduced a tool `hadoop dtutil` that can be used to interact with those Token Storage Files but that's not available in Hadoop 2.

.A single Token
[source,protobuf]
----
message TokenProto {
  required bytes identifier = 1;
  required bytes password = 2;
  required string kind = 3;
  required string service = 4;
}

.A Credentials File
[source,protobuf]
----
message CredentialsKVProto {
  required string alias = 1;
  optional hadoop.common.TokenProto token = 2;
  optional bytes secret = 3;
}

message CredentialsProto {
  repeated hadoop.common.CredentialsKVProto tokens = 1;
  repeated hadoop.common.CredentialsKVProto secrets = 2;
}
